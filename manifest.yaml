  Browser extension to clean URLs that are about to be visited:
  - removes utm_* parameters
  - on item pages of aliexpress and amazon, removes tracking parameters
  - skip redirect pages of facebook, steam and reddit (directly go to the url
  being redirected to, and never hit their outgoing redirect tracking)

  You can now visit and bookmark clean links instead of the long,
  tracking-enabled ones!
